# Time flies... <i>Doesn't it</i>?

> ~~Happy Valentines the first of many of these days. I fall deeper and deeper for you, let me explain the ways.~~

### updating...
> **<u>WOW!</u>** Six months already? That sure flew by fast.<br>Yet here's some deja-vu, a little blast from the past.<br>I love you more than I could ever have planned,<br>All the doubt from others and the distance be damned.<br>Now this poem now something in common with us I find kind of clever.<br>It may have started online, but it'll now last forever.

> <u>L</u> is for <u>Love</u>, its what I'm in with you. Everytime our eyes meet it's like a dream just come true.<br><br><u>O</u> is for <u>Only</u>, like the woman you are in my heart. We'll show the world theres no stop to such a beautiful start.<br><br><u>U</u> is for <u>Unique</u>, because your one of a kind. Everyday your the first and last thought on my mind.<br><br><u>I</u> is for <u>Inspiring</u>, something you are to me. Your love makes me view things in ways I wouldnt normally see.<br><br><u>S</u> is for <u>Sexy</u>, thats not even up for debate. I cant wait to show you off to everyone when we go on our first date.<br><br><u>A</u> is for <u>Always</u>, how long i ~~hope we're~~ ***<u>KNOW THAT</u>*** we'll be together. Rain, sleet, or snow...<br>I know, we can handle the weather.💜💚🩷🩵
